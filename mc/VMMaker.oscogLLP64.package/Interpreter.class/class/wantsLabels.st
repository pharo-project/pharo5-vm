wantsLabels
	"Only label the VM, not plugins (internal or external).  This to cut down the scope
	 of problems with labels being duplicated by C compiler optimizer inlining and
	 loop unrolling.  We use the asmLabel: directive to control labelling in the
	 interpreter proper. But it is too much work doing that for plugins too."
