stackLimitOffset
	"Answer the amount of slots needed to fit a new frame at the point the stack
	 limit is checked.  A frame looks like this at the point the stack limit is checked:
			stacked receiver/closure
			arg0
			...
			argN
			caller's method ip/base frame's sender context
	fp->	saved fp
			method
			method header fields
			context (uninitialized)
			receiver
			first temp
			...
	sp->	Nth temp
	So the amount of headroom is
		the maximum number of arguments + 1 (for stacked receiver and arguments)
		+ the frame size
		+ the max number of temps.
	 Since a method's number of temps includes its arguments the actual offset is:"
