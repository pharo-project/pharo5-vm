SMarkTransporter is a used to interact with a git-fileout system used in the RoarVM project to manage Smalltalk source code.

SMarkTransporter is not actually a Transporter class, since there are currently no needs for customization.
Thus, it is just a dummy class for future use, and to hold #transportersForFileOutMenu.
