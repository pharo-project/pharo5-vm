	"Answer an argument vector of the requested size after a vanilla

	On ARM this typically means accessing r0 through r3 and fetching additional arguments from the stack, acording to pages 20f. aapcs.
	We assume that all arguments are single word arguments, which can not be supplied on co-processor-registers.
	 For compatibility with Cog/Slang we answer unsigned values."
