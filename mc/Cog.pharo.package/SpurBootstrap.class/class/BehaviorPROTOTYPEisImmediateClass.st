BehaviorPROTOTYPEisImmediateClass
	"Answer whether the receiver has immediate instances.  Immediate instances
	 store their value in their object pointer, not in an object body.  Hence immediates
	 take no space and are immutable.  The immediates are distinguished by tag bits
	 in the pointer. They include SmallIntegers and Characters.  Hence in the 32-bit
	 system SmallIntegers are 31-bit signed integers and Characters are 30-bit
	 unsigned character codes."
