TraitBehaviorPROTOTYPEisEphemeronClass
	"Answer whether the receiver has ephemeral instance variables.  The garbage collector will
	 fire (queue for finalization) any ephemeron whose first instance variable is not referenced
	 other than from the transitive closure of references from ephemerons. Hence referring to
	 an object from the first inst var of an ephemeron will cause the ephemeron to fire when
	 the rest of the system does not refer to the object and that object is ready to be collected.
	 Since references from the remaining inst vars of an ephemeron will not prevent the ephemeron
	 from firing, ephemerons may act as the associations in weak dictionaries such that the value
	 (e.g. properties attached to the key) will not prevent firing when the key is no longer referenced
	 other than from ephemerons.  Ephemerons can therefore be used to implement instance-based
	 pre-mortem finalization."
