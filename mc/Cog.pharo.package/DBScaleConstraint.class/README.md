I relate two variables by the linear scaling relationship:
"v2 = (v1 * scale) + offset". Either v1 or v2 may be changed to maintain this
relationship but the scale factor and offset are considered read-only.

Instance variables:
	scale		scale factor input variable <Variable>
	offset		offset input variable <Variable>
