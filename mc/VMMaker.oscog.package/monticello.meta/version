The cache checkprolog collapses these down onto 1 by anding with1 and hence collapses Character''s 2r10 to 0.The cache tag is also tested in the PIC abort routineto distinguish between an MNU abort and an interpretabort.  A PIC MNU entry jumps to code that first zerosthe cache tag (held in ClassReg) before calling theabort routine, which tests ClassReg and selects therelevant abort processing.Hence in 32-bit Spur if a send site is linked forCharacter and later extended to a PIC with aninterpret case, that interpret case will instead invokeMNU processing.  This is rare; first there needs to be asend to a CHaracter, then a send to something elsewhich binds to something that must be interpreted.Ouch.The fix is simple; if a send site that was linked with azero cache tag (which can only happen in 32-bit Spur)link to an open PIC instead of to a closed PIC, or in thecase of an MNU do not link.Changes:Rename compilePICProlog:, mnuCall and interpretCall tothe more accurate compilePICAbort:, picMNUAbort andpicInterpretAbort.  Coment compilePICAbort: andcompileAbort. Name the zero valuepicAbortDiscriminatorValue to make the code morecomprehensible/browsable.Assert that the cache tag is not zero in ceCPICMiss:...Refactor cogMNUPICSelector:methodOperand:numArgs:to add receiver: parameter for the check for a zerocache tag.Eliminate some duplication introduced in early versionsof the ARM abort code.

So when the scavenger reaches a weakcontainer or ephemeron it copies it to future space, leavingbehind a forwarding pointer in the corpse, but it does notyet scavenge its contents.  The corpse is used to constructthe list of scavenged weak/ephemeral objects.  Thecorpse''s forwarding pointer is already taken to point to thesurvivor.  Instead, the list is constructed by having a listhead variable, and linking the list through a value stored insome of the corpse''s unused header fields (format &identityHash).  0 marks the end of the list.  Of course thisdoesn''t work if an object is the first object in newSpace asthis offset will be computed to be zero, improperlyteminating the list!Fix this by adding one to the corpse offset and substracting 1 when decoding.Implement a simple policy to deal with the fact that typicallyheap growth happens during tenuring, not after a failedallocation.  If, after scavenging, the heap has grown by somefactor of its size at the previous global GC, do a global GC.Default the factor to 0.333333.Provide VM parameter access to this value:55	ratio of growth and image size at or above which a GC will be performed post scavengeAdd a printFreeChunks debugging utility that sweepsthrough memory instead of traversing the free lists.Fix the shadowed variable warnings in primitiveIsPinned &primitivePin.  Format the shadowing warning a little more carefully.Simulator:Move the halt on Spur global GC into globalGarbageCollect andnuke the subclass methods.' id '8390b0f2-ae2c-4fc6-9abf-41d6cefda0fd' date '22 May 2014' time '2:00:03.47116352 pm' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.731' message 'Spur:Implement primitives to get (primitiveIsPinned) and (un)set(primitivePin) per-object pinning.' id 'e19b7342-8c8a-4ad8-8acd-64a6c1a7544d' date '21 May 2014' time '3:44:03.554425152 pm' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.730' message 'more typos :-/' id '721dc8e5-985a-41a1-8e5d-09d9095df7d8' date '21 May 2014' time '11:42:01.477098112 am' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.729' message 'Fix a typo to the segment deallocator, for consistency.' id '611ca439-fb89-4d43-a138-ebbd559c605a' date '21 May 2014' time '11:09:01.079294336 am' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.728' message 'Spur:Implement memory shrinkage.Check free space around SpurSegmentManagerprepareForSnapshot & postSnapshot.' id '706ecf52-7165-4829-bfb3-8a9ac4f29216' date '21 May 2014' time '11:01:02.22732704 am' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.727' message 'Spur:Fix assert regression in allInsyances/allObject from introducingMarkObjectsForEnumerationPrimitives=false' id 'c4880b9d-5eff-44bc-8908-a6e831764659' date '20 May 2014' time '3:35:03.473065408 pm' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.726' message 'Now Spur''s object representation implementsgenInnerPrimitiveMirrorNew[WithArg]: we needdefaults for the generic object representation' id 'b0fc7b91-c835-49e5-a4b2-4bdad9a39331' date '20 May 2014' time '2:59:00.275228928 pm' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.725' message 'restrict the NoRegParms attribute to static functions in theinterpreter and/or cogit files.' id '801ca845-7d9b-480f-afb9-be5cbc72d74f' date '20 May 2014' time '2:31:02.121359744 pm' author 'eem' ancestors ((name 'VMMaker.oscog-eem.724' message 'Slang/general:VMBIGENDIAN must *not* be defined during generation.

'Nicolas Cellier bitblt speedupsReference Mantis issues 7802 and 7803Mantis 7802: Fast-up BitBlt rgbAdd ruleCurrent implementation is naive:- adds component by component after shifting and masking- test each component for overflow- recompose the result by shifting/bit-oringIt is possible to process the components all at once instead of looping and it is possible to avoid the test, making a branch free algorithm:- in order to prevent overflowing over the next component, the highest bit of each component is cleared- the last bit of each component is then obtained by overflow free operation (bitXor: instead of +)- overflow condition is tested by some bitops, leaving a 1 on each highest which would overflow, 0 otherwise, which appropriately shifted and multiplied by component mask provide a mask to bitOr: for saturating without testing. Each component has nBits.The componentMask is 1<<nBits-1.The carryOverflowMask is a mask with high bit of each component set to 1.For example with 4 components of 3 bits,noting that 2r1001001001 * 2r111 -> 2r111111111111, we see that we can obtain such carryOverflowMask by a division 2r111111111111 / 2r111 -> 2r1001001001 and a shift << (nBits -1) -> 2r100100100100 Mantis 7803: Fast-up BitBlt alpha blending rulesThe alpha blending rules do apply on each ARGB component:- shift and mask to isolate the component- blend: ((1-alpha)*dst+(alpha*src))/255 (replace src by 16rFF for alpha channel)- or (1-alpha)*dst>>8+src in case of pre-multiplied source- saturate component at 16rFF in case of overflow for pre-multiplied source  (this normally does not happen if source is correctly pre-multiplied)- shift and bitOr: to recomposeEach component is on a byte.Since multiplication spans over 2 bytes, it''s possible to multiply 2 non adjacent components at once without overflowing on the other.Thus, algorithm is applied on _R_B and A_G_>>8.Division by 255 can be obtained by (x+1+(x>>8))>>8 for 0<=x<=16rFFFF.This can easily be extended on two non adjacent bytes.A reduction of about -25% of run time has been measured on an interpreter VM.Note that very same kind of bit trick has been applied on accelerated ARM BitBlt.See also VM-dev thread [Vm-dev] Little speed up of BitBlt alpha-blendinghttp://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/vm-dev/2013-December/014342.html' id
