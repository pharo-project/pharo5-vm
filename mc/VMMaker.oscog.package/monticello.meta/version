7802 and 7803Mantis 7802: Fast-up BitBlt rgbAdd ruleCurrent implementation is naive:- adds component by component after shifting and masking- test each component for overflow- recompose the result by shifting/bit-oringIt is possible to process the components all at once instead of looping and it is possible to avoid the test, making a branch free algorithm:- in order to prevent overflowing over the next component, the highest bit of each component is cleared- the last bit of each component is then obtained by overflow free operation (bitXor: instead of +)- overflow condition is tested by some bitops, leaving a 1 on each highest which would overflow, 0 otherwise, which appropriately shifted and multiplied by component mask provide a mask to bitOr: for saturating without testing. Each component has nBits.The componentMask is 1<<nBits-1.The carryOverflowMask is a mask with high bit of each component set to 1.For example with 4 components of 3 bits,noting that 2r1001001001 * 2r111 -> 2r111111111111, we see that we can obtain such carryOverflowMask by a division 2r111111111111 / 2r111 -> 2r1001001001 and a shift << (nBits -1) -> 2r100100100100 Mantis 7803: Fast-up BitBlt alpha blending rulesThe alpha blending rules do apply on each ARGB component:- shift and mask to isolate the component- blend: ((1-alpha)*dst+(alpha*src))/255 (replace src by 16rFF for alpha channel)- or (1-alpha)*dst>>8+src in case of pre-multiplied source- saturate component at 16rFF in case of overflow for pre-multiplied source  (this normally does not happen if source is correctly pre-multiplied)- shift and bitOr: to recomposeEach component is on a byte.Since multiplication spans over 2 bytes, it''s possible to multiply 2 non adjacent components at once without overflowing on the other.Thus, algorithm is applied on _R_B and A_G_>>8.Division by 255 can be obtained by (x+1+(x>>8))>>8 for 0<=x<=16rFFFF.This can easily be extended on two non adjacent bytes.A reduction of about -25% of run time has been measured on an interpreter VM.Note that very same kind of bit trick has been applied on accelerated ARM BitBlt.See also VM-dev thread
