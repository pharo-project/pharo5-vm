About Cog
---------

Cog is a virtual machine designed for Smalltalk and other similar dynamic languages.  Cog builds on the
Squeak virtual machine adding a stack-to-register-mapping just-in-time compiler, aggressive in-line message
cacheing and effective optimization of Smalltalkâ€™s first-class activation records.  Cog is the virtual machine
underlying Teleplace''s Croquet-based enterprise virtual collaboration spaces software, the fastest virtual
machine for Squeak, and for Gilad Bracha''s Newspeak modular language inspired by Beta and Smalltalk.  
Like the original Squeak VM, Cog is implemented and developed in Smalltalk, and translated into a lower-level
language to produce the production VM.  Being a Smalltalk program it is a delight to develop.  Cog is
available under the MIT open source license and is unencumbered for commercial deployment.

Cog''s performance relative to the existing Squeak interpreter varies, depending on the benchmark chosen.
As of early-2011, the Cog JIT uses strong inline cacheing techniques and stack-to-register mapping that
results in a register-based calling convention for low-arity methods.  Due to the complexity of the Squeak
object representation it has a limited set of primitives implemented in machine code that, for example,
exclude object allocation.  Performance of the early-2011 JIT for the nbody, binarytrees and chameneos
redux benchmarks from the computer language shootout is in the range of 4 to 6 times faster than the
interpreter.
