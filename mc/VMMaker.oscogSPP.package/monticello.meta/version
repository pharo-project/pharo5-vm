This XML file is used for documenting the instruction set, and for helping in generate their implementation by generating automatically code for the StackInterpreter and the StackToRegisterMappingCogit. Code for fetching arguments from the stack and pushing results is generated automatically for the StackInterpreter. In a similar way, code for register allocation is also generated for the StackToRegisterMappingCogit. This boiler plate code generation allows concentrating in implementing the instructions themselves.The tools for generating the instructions from the implementation is avaiable at: http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~ronsaldo/Lowcode . The ConfigurationOfLowcode script will load by default the Lowcode-OpalCompiler that extends Smalltalk with native data types in addition tothe code generation tools.

Perhaps it should be made optional.In addition to the changes into the VMMaker, some changes into the sqMemoryAccess.h are required. Since the StackInterpreter cannot manipulate the C stack directly, it performs this manipulation using a concept similar to the FFI/Alien callout mechanism for being able to call C functions and keeping the same interface as JIT compiler. This mechanism uses a shadow stack for pushing parameters, a callout state structure with shadow registers for sending/receiving data from any function and trampoline function written in assembly. These extra support are placed in sqLowcodeFFI.h and family.If the LowcodeVM variable is false(the default), these modifications and extra files are not required for building a working PharoVM using the Cogit or the StackInterpreter.

Some BitBlt primitives perform the same check, thus not allowing operations with forms with associated bitmaps with a size greater than needed. When performing operations with images, and specially when such images are large in size, actually processing the images takes a small fraction of the time it takes to perform the whole operation, while allocating and deallocating correctly sized bitmaps takes much longer. If one would wish to process a series of similarly sized images (with a definite maximum size), it would be desirable to allocate a bitmap big enough to hold any of them only once and then reuse it, thus avoiding the aforementioned cost. Checking that source and destination bitmaps are big enough instead of checking that their size is exactly that which is expected would allow that optimization.A brief exploration of BitBlt and JPEGReadWriter2''s code, accompanied with some experimenting of what would happen if such sanity checks were modified as proposed, has lead me to thinking that these changes would be benefitial.

Spur''s core primtives are written in the expectation that image-level primitive failure code will deal with the failure and retry.  This corresponds to the VisualWorks style and allows the image to implement GC policy (e.g. to favour reclamation over growth).  So with the current Spur code, heavily influenced by the author''s experience with VisualWorks, it would be inapproprate to retry corte primitives on being out-of-memory.  The pathology is that attempts at very large allocations which will inevitably fail will cause a GC in the VM, very possibly followed by a GC from the image level primitive failure code.  Whereas leaving it to the image, the image code may be intellkigent enough to spot an allocation too large to ever succeed and avoid the GC altogether.I''m not sure if I like this auto-retry or not.  Perhaps it is a good idea and the image-level primitive failure code should be changed; there would certainly be fewer image-level methods.

In 32-bit Spur only zero is a valid cachetag, that for Characters, due to SmallIntegers havingboth 2r11 and 2r01 as valid tags.  The cache checkprolog collapses these down onto 1 by anding with1 and hence collapses Character''s 2r10 to 0.The cache tag is also tested in the PIC abort routineto distinguish between an MNU abort and an interpretabort.  A PIC MNU entry jumps to code that first zerosthe cache tag (held in ClassReg) before calling theabort routine, which tests ClassReg and selects therelevant abort processing.Hence in 32-bit Spur if a send site is linked forCharacter and later extended to a PIC with aninterpret case, that interpret case will instead invokeMNU processing.  This is rare; first there needs to be asend to a CHaracter, then a send to something elsewhich binds to something that must be interpreted.Ouch.The fix is simple; if a send site that was linked with azero cache tag (which can only happen in 32-bit Spur)link to an open PIC instead of to a closed PIC, or in thecase of an MNU do not link.Changes:Rename compilePICProlog:, mnuCall and interpretCall tothe more accurate compilePICAbort:, picMNUAbort andpicInterpretAbort.

'Nicolas Cellier bitblt speedupsReference Mantis issues 7802 and 7803Mantis 7802: Fast-up BitBlt rgbAdd ruleCurrent implementation is naive:- adds component by component after shifting and masking- test each component for overflow- recompose the result by shifting/bit-oringIt is possible to process the components all at once instead of looping and it is possible to avoid the test, making a branch free algorithm:- in order to prevent overflowing over the next component, the highest bit of each component is cleared- the last bit of each component is then obtained by overflow free operation (bitXor: instead of +)- overflow condition is tested by some bitops, leaving a 1 on each highest which would overflow, 0 otherwise, which appropriately shifted and multiplied by component mask provide a mask to bitOr: for saturating without testing. Each component has nBits.The componentMask is 1<<nBits-1.The carryOverflowMask is a mask with high bit of each component set to 1.For example with 4 components of 3 bits,noting that 2r1001001001 * 2r111 -> 2r111111111111, we see that we can obtain such carryOverflowMask by a division 2r111111111111 / 2r111 -> 2r1001001001 and a shift << (nBits -1) -> 2r100100100100 Mantis 7803: Fast-up BitBlt alpha blending rulesThe alpha blending rules do apply on each ARGB component:- shift and mask to isolate the component- blend: ((1-alpha)*dst+(alpha*src))/255 (replace src by 16rFF for alpha channel)- or (1-alpha)*dst>>8+src in case of pre-multiplied source- saturate component at 16rFF in case of overflow for pre-multiplied source  (this normally does not happen if source is correctly pre-multiplied)- shift and bitOr: to recomposeEach component is on a byte.Since multiplication spans over 2 bytes, it''s possible to multiply 2 non adjacent components at once without overflowing on the other.Thus, algorithm is applied on _R_B and A_G_>>8.Division by 255 can be obtained by (x+1+(x>>8))>>8 for 0<=x<=16rFFFF.This can easily be extended on two non adjacent bytes.A reduction of about -25% of run time has been measured on an interpreter VM.Note that very same kind of bit trick has been applied on accelerated ARM BitBlt.See also VM-dev thread [Vm-dev] Little speed up of BitBlt alpha-blendinghttp://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/vm-dev/2013-December/014342.html' id
